# SteamKit2

SteamKit2 is a .NET library designed to interoperate with Valve's [Steam network](https://store.steampowered.com/about).
It aims to provide a simple, yet extensible, interface to perform various actions on the network.

Documentation consists primarily of XML code documentation provided with the binaries, and our [wiki](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/wiki).
